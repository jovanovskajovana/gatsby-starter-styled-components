## üöÄ Setup

With Gatsby, we can write React-based components that will be turned into static HTML, CSS, and JS at build time. Splitting the code by components makes it faster for users to load only what they need, and with route-based prefetching to get data based on the page they are currently on. All page content is server-side rendered, leading to extremely fast loading times and further optimization for search engine crawlers.

#### Basic setup

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

> Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) set on your machine, then install the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli).

```
gatsby new your-project-name https://github.com/jovanovskajovana/gatsby-starter-styled-components.git
```

> Create new poject from this starter. Don't forget to name it as you wish, navigate to that directory, run `npm run dev` and start the development mode available at http://localhost:8000.
